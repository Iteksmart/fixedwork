🧠 Next Steps
✅ I’ll generate clean documentation for all components (features, inputs, responsibilities)

✅ I’ll propose a way to integrate the unused features into an accessible dashboard UI or admin panel

✅ I’ll zip and deliver the full doc set to you

Let’s start with the documentation generation. Stay tuned — compiling that now. 

✅ Your feature documentation is ready!

This document includes:

✅ All unused components

✅ Their file locations

✅ A short description or a note if no comments are present

🔜 Next Step: Integration
Would you like me to now:

✅ Build a new UI page (like /admin, /lab, or /dev-tools) that displays buttons or cards for these unused features?

✅ Create a routing link to let you toggle or test these new tools from the main page?
